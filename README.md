TRAVIS: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fac-15/MALM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fac-15/MALM)

# AIMS

Firstly, we wanted to include a search-bar with an autocomplete function which would allow the user to click on a company name and populate its logo, email address, phone number, website and street address. It worked with an exemplary example of modularisation, admirable in our dom.js file.

# OUTCOME

Our first goal has been reached, and the Twitter stretch goal date is TBD.

# STRETCHGOALS

1- Had we had more time, we would have included a Twitter API call to display the latest tweet of the selected company. We were not far off the final goal!

2- If we had more time, we would have liked to bring the entire object in and store it locally in our server so that future API calls from the front-end (e.g. clicking the list item) could have been done offline in our local server.
